# trigger

A Clojure library designed to create control patterns to Overtone synths. The library is still in it early stages.

## Usage

#### Define synth with control-bus inputs
(defsynth tstsin [in-trg 0 in-trg-val 0 in-attack 0 in-attack-val 0 f 200 out-bus 0] (let [trg (in:kr in-trg)
                                                                                           val (in:kr in-trg-val)
                                                                                           env (env-gen (perc (in:kr in-attack-val) 0.01 1 0) :gate trg)
                                                                                           src (* env (sin-osc (* f val)))]
                                                                                                                                                                                         (out out-bus src)))

Here, in-trg and in-attack are specified as control values in trigger. The software also connects automatically to in-trg-val and in-attack-val. 

##### start the pattern

(-> {:pn "tstsin2" :sn tstsin :in-trg ["[1 1 1 1]"] :in-attack ["[0.05]"] } trg t t)

:pn = Pattern name. The pattern and the trigger synths are storded under the name
:sn = Name of the synth to be used

Pattern structure
["[p1]"  "[p2]"  "[p3]" .. . ]

example:
["[1]"] plays one whole note
["[1 1 1 1]"] plays four quarter notes per second.
["[1 1 1 1]" "[2]"] plays four quarter note and then one  whole note with an value of 2.

New

####
The patterns are structured similary as in TidalCycles, meaning the duration of each pattern  [p] is one second.  The value in the pattern structure is passed in the "*-val" control-bus.  


### Things to chnage in the near future
  - Improved pattern syntax
  - Managing unused buffers. New buffers are created during every instantiation of the pattern and the old ones are not freed yet.
  - Managing output bus and synth arguments
  - Output effects
